# Accessible mini-games
Accessible mini games is a web-based project in React and JavaScript. It is made for the course "Digital Accessibility" at LTH and aims to to be accessible for people with visual impairments.
The goal is to create three simple games, such as memory, quiz and a jumping-game, that can be played by people who use screen readers or have other visual impairments that require a certain type of interface.
